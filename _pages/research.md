__[JMP] [Under-training by Employers in Spot Labor Markets: Evidence from Burundi](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Qs4fdx38cEGLkc-51g_R_CooeZZEwHtr/view?usp=drive_link)__ with Luisa Cefala, Pedro Naso, Michel Ndayikeza

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Abstract:</span> Labor markets in low- and middle-income countries are often organized via short-term informal spot contracts. This market structure may lead employers to underinvest in training workers in general human capital. We explore this phenomenon among agricultural employers in Burundi. We investigate whether employers do not train casual laborers in improved, labor-intensive, agricultural techniques because they do not ``appropriate'' the returns. First, to test for the presence of appropriability failures, we induce a subset of employers to train workers in some local labor markets (villages) and not others. We document that many of the trained workers subsequently work for other employers in the local labor market, so that the training employer captures only a portion of the returns from training. The spillovers onto the other employers (who did not train) are large, leading to increases in use of the new technology and increased profits. Second, we randomize employers into a contract condition that increases the likelihood that the trained worker will work for the training employer in the future, shifting more of the training surplus to the training employer. This contract increases employers' willingness to train by 50 percentage points. Our findings suggest that a sizable wedge between private and social returns to training may impede on-the-job training in spot labor markets, with meaningful consequences for worker productivity and output.

[__Retrieval Failures and Consumption Smoothing:
A Field Experiment on Seasonal Poverty__](/files/2_RetrievalFailures.pdf) with Ned Augenblick, Kelsey Jack, Supreet Kaur, Felix Masiye 

<div class="indented-text" style="font-size: 0.8em; margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 25px; margin-top: -16px">
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Abstract:</span> Individuals may fail to recall and use information they already know when making decisions. We empirically investigate whether such ``retrieval failures'' distort consumption smoothing behavior among Zambian farmers, who derive their income from one annual harvest and then spend it down over the course of the year. We document that individuals underestimate upcoming spending by 50%, creating scope for under-saving. In order to improve recall, we randomize an intervention that prompts individuals to think through their future expenses associatively in categories---without providing any external information or guidance.  Treated individuals increase ``remembered'' expenses by 42%; as predicted by the memory literature, effects are concentrated among small, irregular, and stochastic items. Immediate spending drops and, two months after the intervention, treated households hold 15% higher savings. They subsequently enter the ``hungry season''---the final months of the year when consumption typically declines sharply---with one additional month of savings, leading to a flatter spending profile over the year. Households use the increased savings to self-finance additional farm investment, resulting in a 9% increase in the next year's crop revenue. We replicate the intervention's impact on beliefs among low-income Americans, suggesting that retrieval failures generalize across settings and populations.

__All in the Family: Kinship Pressure and Firm-Worker Matching__ _(Draft in November)_ 


<div class="indented-text" style="font-size: 0.8em; margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 25px; margin-top: -16px">
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Abstract:</span> Many firms in low- and middle-income countries hire family members as employees.  A common explanation for this is informational or contractual advantages associated with hiring network members. This paper investigates whether some of this hiring is driven by redistributive pressure. Using three field experiments in Zambia, I offer rural and urban employers a subsidy to hire a worker for their small business. To introduce variation in social pressure, I introduce some noise in the hiring process, so that sometimes the employer hires their preferred hire, and sometimes not. I then randomize some employers into a condition that lets them signal the noise in the hiring process to others, offering them an excuse - or plausible deniability - for not hiring a family member. I then measure how employers knowing they will have plausible deniability for not hiring from their family changes their hiring decisions. In a first main finding, I show that increased plausible deniability reduces the probability of choosing a relative for the position by as much as 25 percent, suggesting that a non-trivial share of hiring is driven by redistributive pressure. Consistent with the proposed mechanism, this effect is concentrated among employers who report facing higher levels of redistributive pressure at baseline. I then show that hiring a relative has meaningful productivity consequences: among a sample of rural employers, I find that rural employers randomly assigned to hire a related rather than an unrelated employee produce 7 percent lower output. Finally, I show that this pressure is particularly pronounced in cases when it is costlier to measure worker productivity and where the employer and their family disagree about the worker's productivity, suggesting a microfoundation for why such pressure exists and when it will be less pronounced.
