<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Abstract:</span> Labor markets in low- and middle-income countries are often organized via short-term informal spot contracts. This market structure may lead employers to underinvest in training workers in general human capital. We explore this phenomenon among agricultural employers in Burundi. We investigate whether employers do not train casual laborers in improved, labor-intensive, agricultural techniques because they do not ``appropriate'' the returns. First, to test for the presence of appropriability failures, we induce a subset of employers to train workers in some local labor markets (villages) and not others. We document that many of the trained workers subsequently work for other employers in the local labor market, so that the training employer captures only a portion of the returns from training. The spillovers onto the other employers (who did not train) are large, leading to increases in use of the new technology and increased profits. Second, we randomize employers into a contract condition that increases the likelihood that the trained worker will work for the training employer in the future, shifting more of the training surplus to the training employer. This contract increases employers' willingness to train by 50 percentage points. Our findings suggest that a sizable wedge between private and social returns to training may impede on-the-job training in spot labor markets, with meaningful consequences for worker productivity and output.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Abstract:</span> Individuals may fail to recall and use information they already know when making decisions. We empirically investigate whether such ``retrieval failures'' distort consumption smoothing behavior among Zambian farmers, who derive their income from one annual harvest and then spend it down over the course of the year. We document that individuals underestimate upcoming spending by 50%, creating scope for under-saving. In order to improve recall, we randomize an intervention that prompts individuals to think through their future expenses associatively in categories---without providing any external information or guidance.  Treated individuals increase ``remembered'' expenses by 42%; as predicted by the memory literature, effects are concentrated among small, irregular, and stochastic items. Immediate spending drops and, two months after the intervention, treated households hold 15% higher savings. They subsequently enter the ``hungry season''---the final months of the year when consumption typically declines sharply---with one additional month of savings, leading to a flatter spending profile over the year. Households use the increased savings to self-finance additional farm investment, resulting in a 9% increase in the next year's crop revenue. We replicate the intervention's impact on beliefs among low-income Americans, suggesting that retrieval failures generalize across settings and populations.

[__All in the Family: Kinship Pressure and Firm-Worker Matching__](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zE9tk1QWk6QoKPaNyhYL0GeR1MAIL1JV/view?usp=drive_link)


<div class="indented-text" style="font-size: 0.8em; margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 25px; margin-top: -16px">
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Abstract:</span> Many firms in low- and middle-income countries hire family members as employees.  A common explanation for this is informational or contractual advantages associated with hiring network members. An alternate view is that related employees maybe less productive but hired due to redistributive pressure. I design three field experiments to capture these forces, and in particular to test for the role of pressure in hiring decisions. In each experiment, I offer rural or urban employers in Zambia a subsidy to hire a worker. I randomize some employers into a condition that makes it easier for them to tell others that they were unable to choose which employee to hire with the subsidy. I then measure whether employers change who they choose to hire if they have an excuse for not hiring a family member. Employers offered plausible deniability to not hire from their family are as much as 25 percent less likely to select a related employee for the subsidy, suggesting that a non-trivial share of hiring is driven by redistributive pressure. This pressure cost is large: employers in one sample are willing to forgo 20 percent of the daily wage to avoid their relatives learning that they were not selected by the employer. Finally, to measure the productivity of related employees, I randomize employers to receive a subsidy for either a related or unrelated employee, and find that related employees produce seven percent less output.
