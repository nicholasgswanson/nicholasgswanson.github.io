<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Abstract:</span> Labor markets in low- and middle-income countries are often organized via short-term informal spot contracts. This market structure may lead employers to underinvest in training workers in general human capital. We explore this phenomenon among agricultural employers in Burundi. We investigate whether employers do not train casual laborers in improved, labor-intensive, agricultural techniques because they do not ``appropriate'' the returns. First, to test for the presence of appropriability failures, we induce a subset of employers to train workers in some local labor markets (villages) and not others. We document that many of the trained workers subsequently work for other employers in the local labor market, so that the training employer captures only a portion of the returns from training. The spillovers onto the other employers (who did not train) are large, leading to increases in use of the new technology and increased profits. Second, we randomize employers into a contract condition that increases the likelihood that the trained worker will work for the training employer in the future, shifting more of the training surplus to the training employer. This contract increases employers' willingness to train by 50 percentage points. Our findings suggest that a sizable wedge between private and social returns to training may impede on-the-job training in spot labor markets, with meaningful consequences for worker productivity and output.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Abstract:</span> Individuals may fail to recall and use information they already know when making decisions. We empirically investigate whether such ``retrieval failures'' distort consumption smoothing behavior among Zambian farmers, who derive their income from one annual harvest and then spend it down over the course of the year. We document that individuals underestimate upcoming spending by 50%, creating scope for under-saving. In order to improve recall, we randomize an intervention that prompts individuals to think through their future expenses associatively in categories--without providing any external information or guidance.  Treated individuals increase ``remembered'' expenses by 42%; as predicted by the memory literature, effects are concentrated among small, irregular, and stochastic items. Immediate spending drops and, two months after the intervention, treated households hold 15% higher savings. They subsequently enter the ``hungry season''--the final months of the year when consumption typically declines sharply--with one additional month of savings, leading to a flatter spending profile over the year. Households use the increased savings to self-finance additional farm investment, resulting in a 9% increase in the next year's crop revenue. We replicate the intervention's impact on beliefs among low-income Americans, suggesting that retrieval failures generalize across settings and populations.

[__All in the Family: Kinship Pressure and Firm-Worker Matching__](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zE9tk1QWk6QoKPaNyhYL0GeR1MAIL1JV/view?usp=drive_link)


<div class="indented-text" style="font-size: 0.8em; margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 25px; margin-top: -16px">
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Abstract:</span> Many firms in low- and middle-income countries hire family members as employees. A common explanation for this is informational or contractual advantages associated with hiring network members. An alternate view is that pressure to offer financial assistance to extended family in the form of employment may distort employers' hiring decisions. I design three field experiments -- conducted with both urban firms and agricultural employers in Zambia -- to test this hypothesis, and examine its productivity implications. In the first experiment, all firms are offered the chance to receive a 3-month subsidy for hiring a full-time permanent employee. A subset of firms is then randomized to receive plausible deniability in their hiring decision: a poster that suggests the firm may not have been eligible for the subsidy if it hired a relative. When firms know they will have plausible deniability, they are 11 percentage points (20 percent) more likely to choose to hire a non-relative than a relative. Second, it is socially very costly for employers to hire a non-relative: when they have plausible deniability, the subsidy required to get a firm to choose a non-relative rather than a relative falls substantially -- equivalent to 4 percent of total monthly profits. Both these effects are concentrated among firm owners that report higher redistributive pressure at baseline. Third, in a common agricultural job where productivity is measurable -- maize shelling -- the same worker is more likely to shirk when working for a non-related employer, leading relatives to be 7 percent less productive than non-relatives. Consistent with higher moral hazard problems with relatives, employers across samples report that firing a relative would lead to social penalties. Similarly, in the urban sample, treatment effects are higher among firms that report more difficulty in monitoring and verifying worker effort at baseline. These findings suggest that social pressure to hire relatives may distort the composition of employment as well as productivity in developing countries.
